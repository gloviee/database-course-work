# Conclusion

The conclusions provide an assessment of the results obtained and possible areas of its use. The conclusions should contain a brief generalised assessment of the development results, including
in terms of their technical and economic efficiency. It is necessary to compare
the results of all characteristics of the design object with the task and with the main indicators of modern similar objects.

It is necessary to indicate what new technical solution is the basis of the project and what are its
advantages, and what new things the student has proposed.

Based on the findings, recommendations for the use of the development can be provided. They should
be specific and fully supported by the project.
